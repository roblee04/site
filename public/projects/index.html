    var arrPosts = [{"link":"http://localhost:1313/posts/hardest_class/","plain":"Right now, I’m a 4th year computer science and engineering student at SCU.\nI’ve taken many foundational and theoretical/technical courses that had a good amount of difficulty to them. Out of all my courses at SCU, these were probably the most challenging:\nMachine Learning + Data Mining – COEN140 – David Anastasiu Compilers – Coen175 – Darren Atkinson Digital Logic Design – ELEN 160 – Mamudur Rahman\nAny layman would be impressed with the way I was able to take and pass these courses with relatively good grades, but none of them had the difficulty that was on par with middle school pre algebra.\nI distinctly remember my approach to math.\nBeing bored in class (i didn\u0026rsquo;t have any interest in math) Falling behind in class Falling further and further behind because I didn’t understand fundamental concepts Falling behind is a slippery slope Never asking questions Potentially being burned by the teacher Classroom ridicule / fear of Self doubt “When are we gonna need to know this?” a defensive question in order to not having to learn the topic “Math is just something that needs to be done” When school is involved, that topic just becomes less interesting e.g. reading As a result, I hated doing worksheets in class. I distinctly remember my eighth grade math teacher, Mr. Nabas, walking around class and taking a look over our shoulders to see if we were doing our work or if we were stuck… I would always scribble something random on my paper so that he would pass by instead of him asking the dreaded words, “Do you need help?” and having to face my issue of not knowing the math head on.\nIn fact, I hated math since everyone around me seemed to be so “good” at it and I just wasn’t. I knew that I could get better at math if I practiced more and more, but what was the point if I didn\u0026rsquo;t enjoy it? I was falling and slipping further down the slippery slope.\nI was very fortunate enough to have access to mentors, teachers, and tutors to help me, but I never really trusted them to understand my situation. And as a result, I had a C+ in math in 8th grade. Not what you would expect from knowing me right?\nIn highschool, things really stepped up. Grades mattered and they were going to determine what university or college that I was going to go to (and if I was going to be successful in my life). Coming into HS, things were looking good. I took a pre-Geometry class that solidified my foundation for the course, so I had a solid start for HS math.\nBut, being me, my approach didn’t change.\nWhen that time did come to learn math, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand a concept, I started to fall behind.\nFurther.\nFurther.\nAnd Further behind.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t want anyone to know that I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand the concepts, so I never seeked help.\nAs I acknowledged, I fell down a slippery slope of failure. But, my results were of utmost importance, so I had to get it somewhere.\nAt first, I cheated on homework. Not on all of them, but just the few that I didn’t understand. I was never caught, nor punished, but I knew that it was an unsustainable approach. Though, everyone around me was cheating, so why not cheat? I would just be hurting myself if I got a terrible grade…\nSometimes, I really tried to do the homework, but just became stuck. I didn’t give myself resources to ask for help (because usually I was doing it the day before it was due), so my only resources were the web and in the book.\nHere were my two approaches to doing work:\nApproach A Copy answers to homework Turn it in Study later when it was important. Approach B Work on homework. Get stuck. Look at the answers in the back or online. How the fuck did they get this answer. Reverse engineer the solution Repeat for entire homework Turn it in Study 1 or 2 days before exam I’m gonna be honest. This learning approach is kinda not the best way to learn, but it worked for me. This being the case, this was the most roundabout way to achieve it.\nNow, all of this wouldn’t have been an issue if I just… I don’t know…\nLearned the content in class! And / or had a deep understanding of it!\nIf I were back in my middle school days, I would have wished for someone who could erase all of the roadblocks that stopped me from learning as much as I could. Though sometimes it was self-inflicted (shooting myself in the foot), it was the easy thing to do.\nI personally believe that all my previous self needed as a good tutor.\nRemembering my approach to math. I think the best tutor for my previous self would: Help evoke my interest in math Either with an intrinsic approach (u can do multiplication!) “When are we gonna need to know this?” nullified. the cause for it is gone! Or an application of it (triangulation to find a base in MC factions) Be extremely patient. Want to know where exactly my approach is false and building up from there Able to call out if I understood or didn’t understand a solution Inspiring me to look ahead in math instead of just keeping pace with my class. Kinda intrinsic approach Be someone to imitate / role model. “I can try to be like them by learning to do math like them!” Have empathy Evoke confidence in the student by giving them a strong fundamental understanding No one wants to be stupid. Or ask a stupid question, even if they know it helps them. So if they FEEL that they are smart, they would be asking “SMART” questions, which furthers their understanding. It took over 8 years for me to finally learn the “proper” way just because I didn’t have someone who truly understood me.\nNow that I’m here, a quarter away from a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, I am someone who has a great deal of understanding of math and computer science.\nWith my skills, I want to “Be the best version of me”. I want to be that one person who my past self needed. Of course, I’m still just 21, but I think teaching is something I want to do.\n","pubDate":"2024-04-07","title":"The Hardest Class I took was in Middle School"},{"link":"http://localhost:1313/posts/lupinstory/","plain":"LupinStory I tried to recreate a funny little Maplestory game that I played as a little kid.\nIt was called MonkeyStory.\nMaplestory was a big part of my childhood, I played a ton of it with my brother and I remember revolving a lot a lot of time around it.\nSome things I remember:\nRydahMS / MS private servers\nrebirths max stat items voting for NX cheesing Ergoth with heal GMS\nfarming pigs for leather to make work gloves to sell for 1M mesos a pop Demon Slayer vacuum skill on scarecrows mechanic bing cheeling in the Cash Shop and trying on a bunch of cool stuff I wanted to pay homage to it by recreating a tiny flash game version of it.\nIt is very very WIP, but you can try it here!\nhttps://roblee04.github.io/lupinstory/\n","pubDate":"2024-04-01","title":"LupinStory"},{"link":"http://localhost:1313/posts/scu_things/","plain":"Santa Clara University Things I\u0026rsquo;m from the COEN / CSEN, so I can only give you advice from there. social anx, asian\nUse your time at college to explore who you are or want to be.

In the most recent example, ChatGPT and applications of similar large language models can do basic reasoning, arithmetic, and problem solving tasks given that LLMs are just neural networks (pattern recognition machines from how I say it). I am really curious to emergent behavior comes to be in other flavors of science and life in general (brain, biochem, etc).\n@tab Intermediate Forms of Data\nIntermediate forms mainly talk about how something is represented in a versatile form.\nFor example, say that you wanted to greet someone. How can you do that? In English you could say:\nhey hello what\u0026rsquo;s up sup dawg And the list goes on. But, what if you wanted to greet anyone regardless of language? There ain\u0026rsquo;t no way you\u0026rsquo;re going to be learning 10+ language greetings. Why not just wave hello ? That seems pretty easy. And to me, that is a form of intermediate representation.
