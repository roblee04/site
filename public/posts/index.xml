      <description>Right now, I’m a 4th year computer science and engineering student at SCU.&#xA;I’ve taken many foundational and theoretical/technical courses that had a good amount of difficulty to them. Out of all my courses at SCU, these were probably the most challenging:&#xA;Machine Learning + Data Mining – COEN140 – David Anastasiu Compilers – Coen175 – Darren Atkinson Digital Logic Design – ELEN 160 – Mamudur Rahman</description>
