# Who are you Robin ?

I'm currently a senior studying Computer Science and Engineering (CSEN) at Santa Clara University.
I don't entirely have a focus on what I want to do in the future, so I am exploring them all during my time as a student.

# What are some of your academic / technical interests?
I have a multitude of interests, but not enough time to explore them to a high degree:
- Virtualization Technologies 
- Programming Language Theory (Haskell, Scala, Prolog)
- Operating System Implementations
- Compiler Theory
- Chaos Theory
- Physics Simulations (Pendulums, Fluid)
- Math (very broad)
- Philosophy (very broad 2)

# What are some of your normal interests?
I like to do a lot of things for fun:
- Pet my cats
- Talk to my friends and friendly people
- Play League of Legends with friends
- Cook various foods (cutting and preparing)
- Jump into YouTube or Reddit rabbit holes
- Ski
- Longboard
- Wear cool clothes


# If you could only take one thing out of your burning house, what would it be?

Assuming that all my family and cats have evacuated, I would take out the fire!

But on the more serious side, I would take my stuffed elephant, Elephanty.
