# Advice to my previous self and other interesting SCU Things

At the time of this writing, I am freshly graduated with my bachelors from Santa Clara University. \

Physically, I don't feel any different than I did four years ago. Mentally, I feel like I already experienced a lifetime. That's kind of how aging works.


## Academic
Action precedes motivation. 

Everyone has the propensity to learn. (Even little kids)

Try to do the literal best you can (aim for an A) in your classes.

## Social
You're going to grow by new experiences, one of the main ones be via meeting new people.

Focus on yourself. Stand up for yourself.

Avoid gossip and people who enable it.

## Etc
Eat good food.

Do exercise.

Do something useful in your freetime.

# Other SCU Things!

Given my limited scope as a Chinese American COEN / CSEN major, I'm just going to tell you about what I feel like talking about. I'm not going to give a completely objective view, because thats how it is.

### Asian Culture Clubs + APO

These places are a great place for to make new friends, drink, and gossip if you're asian. \

Unfortunately, I have a extreme distaste for gossip. \

CSA and Alpha Phi Omega are the largest offenders. \

2024 / 25 KSA is pretty chill though (due to the current leadership). \

Don't join these clubs unless you really like gossip and tea spilling.


### Sports
Sports is one of the areas that SCU does not hold back in. If you like the sport or just want to chill around, I highly recommend doing some! go broncos \

Badminton:
- Offered as an intramural sport
- Mainly made up of international students (Usually Masters or Phd students)
- Can check open gym times on the SCU website
- join the wechat group (you can dm me)

Boxing Club:
- Highly recommend to join if you are into physical contact sports
- Drama-free and respect correlates to how much work you put in
- Competition team and Chill team
- I love hitting pads.


### Courses:
Cool Classes:
- Anastasiu's CSEN 140 Intro to Machine Learning and Data Mining
- Atkinson's CSEN 175 Compilers and Programming Languages

Cool professors:
