# LupinStory

I tried to recreate a funny little Maplestory game that I played as a little kid.

It was called MonkeyStory.

{{< youtube id="0uCsgnnzHFY" title="Monkey Story v1.1" >}}

Maplestory was a big part of my childhood, I played a ton of it with my brother and I remember revolving a lot a lot of time around it.

Some things I remember:
- RydahMS / MS private servers
    - rebirths
    - max stat items
    - voting for NX
    - cheesing Ergoth with heal

- GMS
    - farming pigs for leather to make work gloves to sell for 1M mesos a pop
    - Demon Slayer vacuum skill on scarecrows
    - mechanic
    - bing cheeling in the Cash Shop and trying on a bunch of cool stuff

I wanted to pay homage to it by recreating a tiny flash game version of it.

It is very very WIP, but you can try it here!
