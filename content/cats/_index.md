## Mimi and Leo
We got them at the start of COVID pandemic so they are currently ~4 years old!

Mimi is an elegant and gentle cat. Her favorite things are wires, wet cat food, and the outside.

Leo is a food motivated kitty. He likes scritches and chin scratches, wet cat food, dry cat food, and human food.

I love both cats equally as they are both special in their own way.
